  Hi, I’m Sean Elefant and I am a Junior Computer Science major at The College of New Jersey, who is also pursuing a minor in Criminology.
      I have always had a knack for problem solving and using that in tandem with my love and passion for technology to create all kinds of applications!
      
 I’m currently learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Python.
